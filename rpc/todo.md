- test: try parsing and type checking generated code to see if it makes sense.
- make stuff functional. remove ctxt. other var refactoring.
- return errs instead of log.Fatal. this'll work better with testing.
- add fixed size []byte support.
- add merkle.Id support. unalias that to []byte.
- generate same pkg name as src.
- how does grpc differentiate fixed vs dynamic size byte sl?
- 1. add epochTy support. unalias to uint64.
- add bool support.
