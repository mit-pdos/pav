## TODO

[ ] test: try parsing and type checking generated code to see if it makes sense.
[ ] make stuff functional. remove ctxt. other var refactoring.
[ ] return errs instead of log.Fatal. this'll work better with testing.
[ ] add fixed size []byte support.
[ ] add merkle.Id support. unalias that to []byte.
[x] generate same pkg name as src.
[x] how does grpc differentiate fixed vs dynamic size byte sl?
[x] 1. add epochTy support. unalias to uint64.
[x] add bool support.
