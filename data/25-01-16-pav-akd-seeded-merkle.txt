setup:
- merkle tree seeded with 1000 vals.
- add to tree over the bench.
- for GetMemb, only query a single val over bench.
- Put / Get only one elem per iter.
- all setup same for both pav and akd.

format: PutNoProof | PutWithProof | GetMemb | GetNonMemb
pav: 144us | 175us | 31us | 8us
akd: 73us | 90us | 9.8us | 11.8us

diffs:
- hash functions.
- our heavy gc pressure. high variability from that.

unexplained:
- akd should be doing a lot less hashes than us, so surprising that Put
is that expensive.
